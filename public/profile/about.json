    "about": "Hi, I'm Sebastian, a machine learning engineer studying for my MSc in Machine Learning at University College London (UCL). I have a background in discrete mathematics and computer science from Reykjavík University, Iceland. \n\nI use AI to solve real-world problems, particularly within healthcare. My personal belief is that in the next decade we will be able to solve significant challenges in cancer research, drug discovery, and gene therapy. \n\nMy hobbies include climbing, brazilian jiu-jitsu, and I consider myself a health enthusiast, shoutout to my boy Andrew Huberman. My goal is to continuously learn, whether it's in the tech industry, or in personal development.",
